## Why React insted of Kivy
In my personal opinion, and in general, react is the same as kivy, exactly, kivy is the same as react, but a bit younger, consequently, the documentation of kivy is very poor, the community is not as active as react, and the most important is the graphical part, couse with react, you can give graphical instructions using css format, you are free, and you can make amazing and stranger shapes, in the other case, kivy is now growing, it needs to be updated in that sense, couse is a bit difficult to handle video shape, or crop widgets inside other widgets.

## Dependencies
